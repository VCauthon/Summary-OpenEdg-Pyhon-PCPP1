# Summary-OpenEdg-Pyhon-PCPP1 ☆ ～('▽^人)


This project is focused on synthesizing study materials from [OpenEdg](https://edube.org/) using Jupyter Notebooks with the aim of preparing for the [PCPP1 certification](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcpp1).

__AKA__: Basically my notes.

> __Suggestion__:
> Consider dedicating a minimum of 2 hours per day to successfully prepare for  the PCPP1 certification within a 3-month timeframe.
